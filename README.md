sssf-courses frontend
My first react.js application
focus on this project was entirely to make a front for using the graphql-API created also for this project @see https://github.com/Ruon1s/sssf-backend and learning a little react on the side.

it is running on: https://sssf-frontend.herokuapp.com/
If you want to test it locally clone the repository, run yarn install and yarn start
